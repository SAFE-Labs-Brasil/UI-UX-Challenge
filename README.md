# SAFE Labs UI-UX Challenge

## Presentation

Hello there SAFE Labs Candidates!

To get a better idea of your design and implementation skills we would like you to work on improving the design of one of our open source projects. 

## The Challenge

The project is called **Points**, you can learn more about it at https://fastruby.github.io/points/ if you are interested (but it's not required for this challenge).

This is a screenshot of the page you'll be working on:

## Task

We would like you to make some design changes to the `/projects` page (the screenshot above). Currently, the page has some issues with spacing and it isnâ€™t easily organized. It also uses some old css techniques that could be improved and it doesn't look right in narrow devices.

We would also like to add our brand somewhere (maybe a `Powered by SAFE Labs` label?).

Get creative, how would you change this page to be more easily understood and interacted with? 

## Notes

* Don't worry about the screens where the buttons would take you, this is just a mock of the real website only created for this test and the buttons are disabled

* This is intended to be a ~2hs project

* You can change anything from the provided css in `css/custom.css` and also the `index.html` if you need to (re-arrange/add tags, add classes, remove things, everything is allowed).

## Deliverables

The deliverable for this challenge is the code, inside a public GitHub repository of yours. You should provide us the URL for it.

We should be able to run your application on our computers, and your README should have all the information necessary for it. 

Send us a report telling how was your experience with this challenge. Even if you can't finish, send the report because for us is more important to know your dedication on a project, thinking, and analytical skills, than looking only at your technical skills.

We will evaluate you based on how well the system is architected, your code and tooling practices, your instructions and documentation on the README.MD and how well you defend your idea and decisions when presenting it to us.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please send an email to your contact at SAFE Labs that we will reply as fast as we can :)
